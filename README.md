# Codereview
Yet another Android Github client.

It's like every Retrofit tuturial, but a bit more comprehensive.

I think there's some cool stuff in it. Like a native git diff viewer. At some point I got bored working on it, so I stopped. Feel free to fork and finish it.


It's using:
 - Kotlin
 - Dagger
 - 'The Square stack'
 - Realm
 - ...
